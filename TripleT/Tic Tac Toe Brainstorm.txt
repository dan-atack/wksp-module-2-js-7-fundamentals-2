Tic Tac Toe Brainstorm

// * Stage I: Create the board: Purely an HTML job
// * Board will consist of 9 divs within another div
// - Will be formatted by css later.
// Also have a paragraph on the side that says whose turn it is.

// Javascript Start:

// Cells are clickable
// Clicking a cell adds a symbol (just Xs to start)
// Clicking a cell changes the next symbol to be placed, and the turn indicator paragraph.
// Add a button to reset the board.
// Create an array representing the values of each cell in JS
// Each turn, use a switch statement to evaluate whether a player has won..
//       (join array and compare vs 8 possible victory strings)
